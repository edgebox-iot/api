# Development notes

To ensure consistent style we leverage `php-cs-fixer`, `PHPUnit` and `PHPStan`

It will run on each commit making sure to warn you when something is wrong.  Make sure to have PHP >= 7.4 installed. To run manually, from the base repository directory, run: 
```bash
./src/vendor/bin/grumphp run
```
