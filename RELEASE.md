# Release

Releasing is controlled by leveraging git tags and releases.

We follow a semantic versioning schema. e.g. `1.2.3`.


## Pre-releases

Sometimes we may wish to rollout a beta version of the addon to deploy for testing before releasing more widely.

This is done by suffixing `-beta.x` to the version. e.g. `1.2.3-beta.1`.
